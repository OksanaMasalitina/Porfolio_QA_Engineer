# Porfolio_QA_Engineer
Welcome to my QA Engineer portfolio. You'll find examples of tasks and test documentation I completed during my studies in three several manual testing courses. These examples showcase my skills in working with requirements, test design, creating test cases, bug reporting, and knowledge of  SQL, HTML, and API testing. I also added my certificates and CV.

Due to NDA agreements, I cannot share examples from my current work on commercial projects. However, I can assure you that these experiences, especially in mobile application testing, have significantly enhanced my expertise and understanding of QA practices in real-world scenarios.

Additionally, I have a [course project](https://github.com/OksanaMasalitina/MasAutoTest_GL) focused on test automation, which is available in a separate repository. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement automated testing solutions.
